# NewProject

a. A brief outline of your approach
- Although the test requirements are quite simple, I still want to give the best possible demo

b. How much time you spent on which aspects of the application
- With all the UI/UX/Animation cost me half a day
- And half day for setting Firebase data store

c. Any known issues or limitations of the solution.
- It's just a demo so currently I've no issues or limitations so far
